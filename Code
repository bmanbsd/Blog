 <p>Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Shai Gilgeous ALexander has missed the past several games with a foot injury. He was expecteds to return this week back has been set back another 2 weeks after an evaluation. Shai has had an outstanding 3rd year averaging 22 points per game. The Thunder have struggled without him going 4 and 6 in their last 10 games. Coach Daigneault stated:“He’s definitely progressed, but not to the point we would have liked,” Daigneault said. “He’s probably a little bit behind what we were looking for.” Do the Thunder still have a chance to make the playoffs with the return of Shai? They are currently thet 11 seed in the westsern conference and sit 6 games behind playoff contention. They will have to make a pushto make it and maybe with the return of Shai, it is possible.  </p>

    <p> As the NBA season is nearing towards the end, many teams have began hot streaks and have been playing some of their best basketball of the season. The 1 seed Sixers have stayed consistent over the course of the season and have proved they are serious title contenders after a dissapointing early exit last season. The Clippers fall to the 2nd seed as they have continued to play well, but Sixers have been on a whole new level. The susn have also fell to the the 3rd seed. A big story is last years champions, the Lakers, who have fallen all the way to the 9 seed as they continue to struggle without Lebron James or Anthony Davis. They are hoping just to stay in the playoff picture ao their 2 best players can come back well rested and ready for playoff time as they seek to become back to back champions.</p>
